          We offer a simple and straightforward cancellation and refund policy, too. All of our
          tours can be cancelled up to five days before departure with no cancellation fee.
          The only thing you'll be liable for is the payment processing fee.

          there's a cancellation fee of 10% of the total fee. Any refund
          required will be processed on the credit card you paid with.
